##The Hogwarts School Database.

I was looking for a nice database that I could practice on and learn SQL in a convenient and interesting way.

I found something nice here: https://github.com/thedevelopnik/hogwarts-sql
 
The problem was that I could not install it on SSMS.

So after I solved some problems - I created a script that can be copied and run in a new query in SSMS and it will do all the work ..

Query ideas:
   * How many students attend Hogwarts?
   * How many students are in a specific house?
   * How many students are taking a class by a given teacher?
   * How many students are of a given year?
   * Which students have no parents?
   
###Again; the credit for the database itself belongs to:
###https://github.com/thedevelopnik/hogwarts-sql
###I just built the script.
